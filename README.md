## Dependencies
### Lightweight Communication and Marshalling (LCM)
LCM is used to send information between various parts of our setup. LCM comes with its share of dependencies as well, and installation instructions can be found at https://lcm-proj.github.io/build_instructions.html

Building the python release of LCM can be a bit tempermental, and it was necessary to update XCode and reinstall glib to get it to install and build correctly.

### Python3
This project uses Apple's v3.6.1 Python release. It is recommended that the user works within a virtual environment to ensure their Python release is compatible.
