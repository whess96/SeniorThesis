# 12/10 Meeting with Rowley

## Updates for Professor Rowley
* Physical materials have arrived:
    - Plane
    - 2x Transmitters
    - Batteries (maybe the wrong one)
    - Chargers
    - Work table (fluids lab)
* Training
    - Contacted the studio lab about vicon stuff
        + Haven't heard back yet
* Research leads
    - Previous thesis courtesy of Stengel


## TODO
* Get permission to fly inside Jadwin
    - Need to be able to fly it in a confined space.
    - Basically need to verify if the plane will work
* Figure out Vicon stuff
    - Go to open hours today, see what's up
    - If that doesn't work, talk to Ani and see if there's a grad student who can help
        + Vince Pacelli?
* Going to start making the dynamic model of the plane
* Get step response. See how bad the training port lag really is as a baseline.
* Adaptive Control aspect
    - Try simple case (select between 2 different models, broken or not broken)
    - Typically have some model with a few unknown parameters. Update these as the plane flies
        + Try just to learn one parameter online
            * coefficient for example
            * Pick a parameter that we can change manually
    - Have the rudder jammed to the side or jam an aileron
* Start make a more in depth calendar with intermediate steps and goals
    - Basically get our shit together
