# 10/18 Meeting with Majumdar

* Troubles with previous projects
    * Trying to do ofboard controls with the Vicon system
    * Used an RC trainer port to control the plane
    * Waaaay too much delay
* Indoor vs. Outdoor
    * Maybe have it fly with a loop
    * FAA and Princeton regulations with flying outside
* Lab space in Forrestal
    * Potentially ok to use it
    * 60' x 25' x 14'
    * Definitely logistically complicated outdoors
* Types of planes to look for
    * Eflight planes tend to be pretty good, but can be very light
        * Phosphor or something?
    * Try to look for smaller planes
* Other potential platforms
    * Parrot Swing Drone
* Vicon System
    * Tracking is trivial, sending signals to the plane is a bit more complicated
    * Have to figure out how to send signal via usb
        * Need to really figure out how to minimize delay
